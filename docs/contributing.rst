Maintainers
-------------

If you need to get hold of a buildtest maintainer, please contact one of the maintainers.

Maintainers are listed in alphabetical order by last name:

- Shahzeb Siddiqui (**@shahzebsiddiqui**)

- Vanessa Sochat (**@vsoch**)


General Tips
-------------

1. It's good practice to link PR to an issue during commit message. Such as stating ``Fix #132`` for fixing issue 132.

2. If you have an issue, ask your question in slack before reporting issue. If your issue is not resolved check any open issues for resolution before creating a new issue

3. For new features or significant code refactor please notify maintainers and open an issue before working on task to keep everyone informed.

4. If you open an issue, please respond back during discussion, if there is no activity the issue will be closed.

5. Please don't open a duplicate issue if there is an existing issue addressing similar problem, instead you can participate in discussion in the issue or contact appropriate individuals directly in slack

6. There should not be any branches other than ``master`` or ``devel``. Feature branches should be pushed to your fork and not to origin
