as it will test your pull request before merging to ``devel`` branch.



GitHub Actions
--------------

buildtest runs a few automated checks via GitHub Actions that can be found in ``.github/workflows``

- **Black** - buildtest is using `black  <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ to format Python code. We let **black** take care of formatting the entire project so you can focus more time in development. The workflow is defined in `black.yml <https://github.com/HPC-buildtest/buildtest-framework/blob/devel/.github/workflows/black.yml>`_

- **URLs-checker** - buildtest is a GitHub action called **URLs-checker** found at https://github.com/marketplace/actions/urls-checker. The workflow is defined in `urlchecker.yml <https://github.com/HPC-buildtest/buildtest-framework/blob/devel/.github/workflows/urlchecker.yml>`_

GitHub Hooks
------------

The above actions check formatting, but are conservative and do not do commits to fix issues on behalf of the user.
To support an easier workflow, we have provided a git hook that you can install locally to run black directly before each
commit. To install the hook, simply copy the file to the ``.git/hooks`` folder as follows::

    cp .github/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/


This hook will exit on error either if you don't have black installed::

    pip install black==19.3b0


or if you have black installed, but running it on the repository code results in an error due
to a functional issue with the code. Code that simply needs to be formatted will be formatted,
and then the commit will follow.

Once you have installed the ``pre-commit`` hook and black, then you can expect
black will auto-format your code during the commit phase. Here is a snapshot of
what the pre-commit hook will do ::

    $ git commit -m "test black on one of the regtest"
    Black is installed
    reformatted /mxg-hpc/users/ssi29/buildtest-framework/tests/test_inspect.py
    All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
    1 file reformatted, 39 files left unchanged.
    [test_black_hook 008fc62] test black on one of the regtest
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

The pre-commit hook will auto-format specific directories where python files are found. Refer to the
pre-commit hook (``.github/hooks/pre-commit``) for more details.

If you are interested in running black locally to see diff result from black without auto-formatting code,
you can do the following::

    $ black --check --diff .

GitHub Bots
-----------

Buildtest has a few bots to do various operations that are described below.

- **Stale**  - buildtest is using `Stale <https://github.com/marketplace/stale>`_ to close outdated issues. This is configured in ``.github/stale.yml``. If there is no activity on a issue after certain time period, **probot-stale** will mark the issue and project maintainers can close it manually. For more details on Stale refer to the `documentation <https://probot.github.io/>`_

- **Issue-Label-Bot** - buildtest is using `Issue-Label-Bot <https://github.com/marketplace/issue-label-bot>`_ to mark issues using Machine Learning. The configuration can be found at `issue_label_bot.yaml <https://github.com/HPC-buildtest/buildtest-framework/blob/devel/.github/issue_label_bot.yaml>`_. The **issue-label bot** will marking incoming issues with the corresponding labels.
