GitHub Integrations
====================

buildtest has several github integration, including automated checks during PR that maintainers will check
during the PR review. You should check results from the `buildtest actions <https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest/actions>`_
that are also typically linked as part of the pull request testing suite.

It's good practice to check Travis `builds <https://travis-ci.com/buildtesters/buildtest>`_ since we use Travis
to run regression test and Codecov and Coveralls depend on Travis to pass all checks.

You will want to make sure code is formatted via black as we have automated checks for python formatting. If you have not
setup the black hook check out :ref:`black_hook`

If you notice the black linter step in `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest/actions>`_ is
failing, make sure you have the right version of black installation.

GitHub Apps
------------

The following apps are configured with buildtest.

- `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.com/buildtesters/buildtest>`_ - Test and deploy with confidence. Trusted by over 800,000 users, Travis CI is the leading hosted continuous integration system.

- `CodeCov <https://codecov.io/gh/buildtesters/buildtest>`_ - Codecov provides highly integrated tools to group, merge, archive and compare coverage reports

- `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/github/buildtesters/buildtest>`_ - Coveralls is a web service to help you track your code coverage over time, and ensure that all your new code is fully covered.

- `CodeFactor <https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/buildtesters/buildtest>`_ - CodeFactor instantly performs Code Review with every GitHub Commit or PR. Zero setup time. Get actionable feedback within seconds. Customize rules, get refactoring tips and ignore irrelevant issues.

- `Snyk <https://app.snyk.io/org/buildtesters/>`_  - Snyk tracks vulnerabilities in over 800,000 open source packages, and helps protect over 25,000 applications.

GitHub Actions
--------------

buildtest runs a few automated checks via GitHub Actions that can be found in ``.github/workflows``

- `Black  <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ - Black auto-formats Python code, so we let **black** take care of formatting the entire project so you can focus more time in development. The workflow is defined in `black.yml <https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest/blob/devel/.github/workflows/black.yml>`_.

- `urlchecker-action <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/urlchecker-action>`_ - is a GitHub action to collect and check URLs in project code and documentation. There is an automated check for every issued PR and the workflow is defined in `urlchecker.yml <https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest/blob/devel/.github/workflows/urlchecker.yml>`_

Configuring Black Pre-Commit Hook
-----------------------------------

To configure pre-commit hook, make sure ``pre-commit`` is available if not
``pip install pre-commit``. The pre-commit is available if you install buildtest
dependencies.

You can configure ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` with the version of python you are using.
It is currently setup to run for python 3.7 version as follows::

    language_version: python3.7

Alter this value based on python version you are using or refer to `black version control integration <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/version_control_integration.html>`_.

To install the pre-commit hook run::

    $ pre-commit install
    pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit


This will invoke hook ``.git/hooks/pre-commit`` prior to ``git commit``. Shown below
we attempt to commit which resulted in pre commit hook and caused black to format code.

::

    $ git commit -m "test black commit with precommit"
    black....................................................................Failed
    - hook id: black
    - files were modified by this hook

    reformatted buildtest/config.py
    All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
    1 file reformatted.


If you are interested in running black locally to see diff result from black without auto-formatting code,
you can do the following::

    $ black --check --diff .

The changes will be shown with lines removed or added via ``-`` and ``+``. For more details refer to `black documentation <https://github.com/psf/black>`_.

pyflakes
----------

There is an automated test to check for unused imports using pyflakes. pyflakes
should be available in your python environment if you installed buildtest extra
dependencies in requirements.txt (``pip install -r docs/requirements.txt``).

You can run pyflakes against buildtest source by running::

    pyflakes buildtest

If you see errors, please fix them and wait for CI checks to pass.


GitHub Bots
-----------

buildtest has a few bots to do various operations that are described below.

- `Stale <https://github.com/marketplace/stale>`_  - stale bot is used to close outdated issues. This is configured in ``.github/stale.yml``. If there is no activity on a issue after certain time period, **probot-stale** will mark the issue and project maintainers can close it manually. For more details on Stale refer to the `documentation <https://probot.github.io/>`_

- `CodeCov <https://github.com/marketplace/codecov>`_ - The codecov bot will report codecov report from the issued pull request once coverage report is complete. The configuration for codecov is defined in ``.codecov.yml`` found in root of repo.

- `Pull Request Size <https://github.com/marketplace/pull-request-size>`_ - is a bot that labels Pull Request by number of **changed** lines of code.

- `Trafico <https://github.com/marketplace/trafico-pull-request-labeler>`_ - is a bot that automatically labels Pull Request depending on their status, during code reviews. The configuration is found in ``.github/trafico.yml``.
