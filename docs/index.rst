==========

`buildtest <https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest>`_  is
a testing framework designed to automate testing on any Linux systems including HPC clusters, workstation, or laptop.
buildtest provides several json-schemas that define how to write your test-configuration (YAML) also known as **Buildspecs**
that buildtest translates into a shell script.
